"""
this file is implementation for the proxy 2, fourth entity in data flow (4/5)
proxy 2 is the part who receiving the encrypted message (file) via UDP (User Datagram Protocol) socket
and sending to the receiver using a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) socket.

here is the point that we are after the "iron wall", we got inside the system and from now can use
two-directional protocols, which means we can use TCP to ensure reliability.
