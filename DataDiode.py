"""
this file is implementation for the data diode, third entity in data flow (3/5)
data diode is the part who receiving the encrypted message (file) via UDP (User Datagram Protocol) socket
and sending to proxy 2 server using a UDP socket.

since data diode fully based on UDP sockets, it ensures that data will flow only in one direction,
that: [sender <-> proxy1] -> [data-diode] -> [proxy2 <-> receiver], we can think about the data-diode
like as on an "iron wall" which data can only reach inside but do not can get outside
